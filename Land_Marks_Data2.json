Salah Ad-Din worked on spreading the Sunni doctrine instead of Shiism that was common in the Fatimid period. The Ayyubid dynasty was a military state as it appeared during the turbulent time of crusader attacks on Egypt and the Levant (Ash-sham). In light of this political context, Salah al-Din decided to build a citadel in Cairo, the construction of which began in 527 AH/ 1176 A.D. Its completion, however, did not take place during his lifetime, but later in 1208 A.D. In addition to this, Egypt\u2019s rule extended to the Levant (Ash-sham) , the Hijaz, Yemen, Nubia, and parts of North Africa.  Ayyubid  Reign stayed in Egypt for 81 years and ended on the hands of the Mamelukes.",

        "description": "The Citadel of Sultan Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi (Saladin) is one of the most iconic monuments in Islamic Cairo, and among the most impressive defensive fortresses dating to the Middle Ages. Its strategic location on the Muqattam Hills gave it a formidable defensive position, and offered, as it still does today, an unrestricted panoramic view of Cairo.\n\n          Sultan Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi was the first to order the construction of a fortress over the Muqattam Hills in (572 AH/ 1176 AD), but it was not completed during his lifetime. This was achieved during the reign of Sultan al-Kamel ibn al-Adel (604 AH/1207 AD) who decided to reside in it, making it the official residence of the rulers of Egypt. In the mid-nineteenth century, Khedive Ismail moved the official residence to Abdeen Palace in downtown Cairo.\n\n          The Citadel witnessed some of the most significant events in Egyptian history from the time it was built to the end of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, which was in power from the early nineteenth century until the 1952 revolution, when the modern Egyptian republic was born. Many monuments were added to the Citadel over the centuries, providing visitors today with an array of places to visit, such as the Mosque of Muhammad Ali Pasha, which dominates the Citadel. Other places to visit include the mosque of the Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun, the Ottoman-era Sulayman Pasha al-Khadim Mosque, as well as a number of museums such as the Police Museum, Al-Jawhara Palace Museum, and the Military Museum.",

The museum was established through the efforts of Marcus Simaika Pasha, a prominent Coptic figure who was vested in the preservation of Coptic heritage. Simaika Pasha bought and collected Coptic antiquities and various architectural elements from older churches that were undergoing renovation, and used them to built the museum and establish its collection.\n\nThe collection represents Coptic history from its earliest beginnings in Egypt through to its rise as a leading center of Christianity in the world. Coptic Christianity traces its origins to a visit by Saint Mark in the city of Alexandria in the 1st Century A.D. The artifacts on display in the museum show the merge of Coptic art with the prevailing cultures including Pharaonic, Greek, Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman, and its evolution in developing its own character and identity.\n\nMagnificently decorated manuscripts, icons, delicately carved woodwork and elaborate frescos with religious scenes recovered from ancient monasteries and churches are among its extensive collection.",

        "description": "The Graeco-Roman Museum of Alexandria is one of Egypt's principal museums, the oldest building in Egypt to be architecturally designed for the purpose of preserving and displaying antiquities. Furthermore, it is the only museum fully dedicated to the antiquities and civilization of Egypt during the Greek and Roman eras.\n\nSince 1889, the Italian Giuseppe Botti sought to establish a museum for Alexandria that would protect its antiquities from displacement and destruction. He continued to work on that until the decision to establish the museum was issued on June 1, 1892. The museum began in a modest rented property, and Khedive Abbas Helmy II inaugurated it on 17 October 1892. Giuseppe Botti was its first director.\n\nSince its inception, the museum has sparked a cultural renaissance about interest in the city\u2019s archaeological activities. Discoveries increased, and there became a pressing need for a new spacious building. On September 12, 1894, Nubar Pasha laid the cornerstone for the new museum to be built on land owned and adjacent to the Municipal Council. The new structure was designed by the architects Dietrich and Stenon in a neoclassical style. The construction process took one year, and it was inaugurated again by Khedive Abbas Helmy II on September 26, 1895.\n\nAfter Botti's death in October 1903, the management of the museum remained Italian, Evaristo Breccia took charge in April 1904, and Achille Adriani succeeded him from 1932 to 1940. from 1940-1947, the museum was run by Alan Rowe. from 1948 to 1953, Adriani took over management once more. Egyptian archaeologists have been in charge of the museum since 1953 onward.\n\nIn 1982, a development project was implemented for the museum, during which a new wing was added connecting the western and eastern wings. In September 2005, a decision was made to close the museum in order to carry out a comprehensive project to expand and develop the museum. The project stalled for ten years until work was resumed in April 2015. By creating an upper floor, a new interior design, and a new display scenario are applied.\n\nto download Graeco-Roman Museum brochure click here!",

The museum displays an extensive collection spanning from the Predynastic Period to the Greco-Roman Era.\n\n          The architect of the building was selected through an international competition in 1895, which was the first of its kind, and was won by the French architect, Marcel Dourgnon. The museum was inaugurated in 1902 by Khedive Abbas Helmy II, and has become a historic landmark in downtown Cairo, and home to some of the world\u2019s most magnificent ancient masterpieces.\n\n          Among the museum\u2019s unrivaled collection are the complete burials of Yuya and Thuya, Psusennes I and the treasures of Tanis, and the Narmer Palette commemorating the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under one king, which is also among the museum\u2019s invaluable artifacts. The museum also houses the splendid statues of the great kings Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, the builders of the pyramids at the Giza plateau. An extensive collection of papyri, sarcophagi and jewelry, among other objects, completes this uniquely expansive museum.",

The Mamluk sultan al-Ashraf Abu al-Nasr Qaitbay built it between 882 AH/ 1477 AD and 884/ 1479 AD over the ruins of Alexandria\u2019s Lighthouse. It served as Alexandria\u2019defence against naval attacks.\n\nThe citadel was made of limestone and spanned an area of approximately 17550 m2. An outer wall plotted with defence towers surrounds the building.\n\nAn inner wall surrounds the citadel\u2019s courtyard and includes a number of rooms some of them used as barracks and others for storage.\n\nThe citadel\u2019s entrance leads to the courtyard where we find the main tower located in the northwest. It consists of a massive three-floored square fort. Its four corners are occupied by half-circular towers that carry protruding balconies for the defence of the city. A tank near the tower supplied soldiers and their horses with water.\n\nQaitbay citadel drew the attention of rulers throughout the ages, on account of its strategic location. The building was also enlarged and subject to other conservation operations in 2003.",

        "description": "The Palace of Muhammad Ali Pasha (1220-1264 AH \\ AD 1805-1848), founder of modern Egypt, is a rare masterpiece that brings together elements of nature, architecture and art. The palace combines elements of European aesthetics with Islamic architecture. Its construction began in 1223 AH / AD 1808, when Muhammad Ali decided to build Shubra Suburb, which was the northern promenade of Cairo. The palace was completed in 1237 AH / AD 1821, spanning a vast area of fifty acres across a suburb on the east bank of the Nile in Cairo. Today, this suburb is called Shubra al-Kheima and the Muhammad Ali Palace has become known as Paradise Palace or Shubra Palace.\nThe architectural plan of the palace was centred within a massive garden that included clusters of buildings surrounded by a wall. Initially, the palace consisted of the Saraya al-Ekama (Residential Palace), Saray al-fasqiyya (Fountain Palace) and saray al-gabalaya. It also included a bird tower, boat harbour, Hydraulic wheel (Saqqyia) that provided the palace and its garden with water, and stables known as the Shubra Stables.\nThe style employed in the palaces took on the character of 19th century Italian and French aesthetics. This was also the first building in Egypt to incorporate a modern lighting system, when Muhammad Ali Pasha commissioned the English engineer Galloway to install lighting fixtures in the palace.\nThe palace underwent extensive restoration and was reopened in 2005, after which it witnessed several important events, providing a wonderful location for receiving official delegations. After 2011 it remained closed, but given its historical and artistic value, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, in cooperation with the Armed Forces Engineering Authority resumed restoration and development plans in 2018. The restoration work included floors and walls, raising the efficiency of the picturesque lake, restoring and maintaining inscriptions and decorations, in addition to linking the palace to the Nile pier for ease of movement for visitors.",

It served as the residence of Fatma al- Zahra\u2019, daughter of Prince Ali Haider, a descendent of Muhammad Ali Pasha.  The palace serves as a striking backdrop to the magnificent possessions owned by the family. It uniquely merges between European and Islamic styles, reflecting the fine taste of the royal family whose paintings, gilded ceilings, and mosaics decorate the palace rooms. The palace consists of two wings, eastern and western, connected by a corridor. Each wing has a basement and two floors.\n\nThe possessions amassed by the family over the period of their rule are on display in the various halls. A diamond and emerald inlaid collar belonging to the founder of the dynasty, Muhammad Ali Pasha, is among the museum\u2019s collection. The lavish lifestyle of the family is reflected in a gold chessboard, golden binoculars encrusted with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and gold cups inlaid with precious stones. Also on display are elaborate jewelry sets commissioned by the greatest designers in Europe, which once adorned the queens and princesses of Egypt\u2019s royal family.",

Located on Jebal Yashkur (in modern-day Ahmad Ibn Tulun Square, Sayyida Zaynab), the mosque was meant to serve as the main congregational mosque of Ibn Tulun\u2019s new administrative capital, al-Qata\u2019i. The building of this mosque was a further step in asserting Ahmad Ibn Tulun\u2019s independence from the \u02bfAbbasid Caliphate.\n\nThe mosque is distinguished by its spiral minaret, which echoes the designs of the al-Abbas mosque in Samarra, Iraq. The arches and the windows of the mosque\u2019s courtyard contain stucco designs of geometric and floral designs. A water fountain is positioned in the center of the courtyard, surmounted by a dome supported on marble columns. The interior of the mosque contains six mihrabs. The mihrab is a niche in the wall of a mosque that marks the qibla, the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca, which Muslims face during prayer. The main mihrab is hollow and elaborately decorated.\n",

Flood levels affected agricultural productivity, so another major purpose of Nilometers was to set taxation levels.\n\nBuilt on the order of the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil in 247 AH/861 AD, the Nilometer on Rawda Island is one of the oldest in Egypt. It is also the oldest structure built after the Arab conquest (20 AH/640 AD) that survives in its original form. The annual seven-day celebration of the Nile flood, which took place from the medieval period down to the end of the nineteenth century, was attended by the sultan himself along with his senior officials.\n\nThe Rawda Island Nilometer consists of a marble octagonal column 19 cubits in length in the middle of a stone-lined well that is rectangular at the top, and circular at the bottom. Qur\u2019anic texts relating to water, vegetation, and prosperity are carved on the walls of the well, as are measuring marks on the column, which were used to determine the height of the flood as the water rose through the well. A stairway spirals down to the bottom.",

General \u02bfAmr ibn al-\u02bfAs was one of the first companions of the Prophet Muhammad. After conquering Egypt in 20 AH/640 AD, he founded its first Islamic capital, Fustat, which falls within the modern city of Cairo. A year later, by order of the Caliph \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab, he also founded the eponymous mosque of \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018As, which thus became the new capital\u2019s very first building.\n\nDuring the early years following the conquest, the mosque served as a place of gathering for Muslim community and \u2018Amr\u2019s troops, which at the time remained a minority in Egypt. Several of the Prophet\u2019s companions assisted in the building\u2019s construction, including al-Zubayr ibn al-\u2018Awam and Ubada ibn al-Samit.\n\nThe structure underwent many architectural changes throughout its lifetime, such that very little of the original survives today. What currently stands in Old Cairo is the mosque\u2019s twentieth century reconstruction. However, it remains true to the modesty of Islamic architecture in its earliest form, evolving from a shed with palm-tree columns to the elegant arcade halls that still house prayers to this day.",

It remains the last surviving member of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and took an estimated 10 to 20 years to build. To this day, it is not entirely certain how this was done.\n\nThe Great Pyramid is made of local limestone, but its exterior was once entirely covered with high quality limestone. These casing stones were brought from Turah, south of Maadi, by ship. On the inside, the pyramid has three chambers, one cut into the bedrock underneath, and two high up within the masonry itself, a feature that no other pyramid possesses. The sarcophagus in which Khufu was once laid to rest can still be seen in the upper of these two rooms, the King\u2019s Chamber. This room is accessed through the Grand Gallery, a majestic corbelled ascending passage, and a masterpiece of ancient engineering and architecture.\n\nTwo large and impressive ships were discovered in pits on the south side of the pyramid in a dismantled state. These are believed to have been used to transport the royal mummy and burial equipment to the tomb.",

He was most likely the son of Khafre (Khefren), and grandson of Khufu (Cheops). With a base area that is less than a quarter of their pyramids\u2019, and with an original height of 65 meters, Menkaure\u2019s is by far the smallest of the three. This reduction in size is due to several factors, including the limited amount of space left on the Giza Plateau. The material used for the outer casing of Menkaure\u2019s pyramid is another. Whereas his predecessors had used limestone for this purpose, Menkaure employed granite, which was quarried in Aswan, over 800 km away. In addition to the logistics involved in transportation of the granite blocks, the material itself is much harder than limestone. However, only the bottom quarter of the casing stones are made of granite however, the rest being limestone.\n\nLike the Great Pyramid, three smaller pyramids can be seen next to Menkaure\u2019s as well, which were used for the burials of his queens. No satellite pyramid has been discovered, however, but it is believed that the largest of the three queens\u2019 pyramids was in fact originally intended to have been the satellite pyramid.\n\n Menkaure died before his pyramid complex was completed, and much of the pyramid\u2019s granite casing blocks were not smoothed. His mortuary and valley temples were intended to consist of colossal limestone blocks encased in granite, but were actually completed with whitewashed mud brick. Despite this, however, the mortuary cult of Menkaure was practiced for another 300 years after his death.",

This was where the workers who built the pyramid complexes of Khafre (c.2558\u20132532 BC) and Menkaure (c.2532\u20132503 BC) lived. The tantalizing  remains of an even older settlement underneath may date to Khufu\u2019s reign (c.2589\u20132566 BC). Houses, magazines, three main streets, and a royal administrative building were discovered within the city walls, as were four huge galleries. These may have been the barracks in which the workers who built the pyramids slept and prepared their food. An enormous amount of fish, bird, cattle, sheep, goat, and pig bones were found, revealing that the state ensured that the workers were in good health so they could fulfill their physically demanding responsibilities.\n\nOn the hillside immediately to the west of Heit al-Ghurab is the town\u2019s cemetery. Low-ranking overseers of workmen were buried in modest mastabas on the low slopes of the hill, surrounded by even smaller mastaba or domed tombs, possibly those of their extended families and the workers they supervised. These were largely built of mudbrick, whereas the higher-ranking overseers and skilled craftsmen were buried in large stone mastabas higher up the slope. Among these is the beautifully decorated tomb of the overseer of linen, the overseer of the royal house of purification, Nefertheith. The majority of the bodies discovered show evidence of hard physical labor, many even featuring broken bones. Most of these had healed correctly, however, indicating that, in addition to being well-fed, the workers also received very good medical care.",

Each of these spectacular structures served as the final resting place of a king of the 4th Dynasty (c.2613\u20132494 BC). The Great Pyramid of Giza was built for king Khufu (c.2589\u20132566 BC), and the other two for Khafre and Menkaure, his son and grandson. Khufu\u2019s pyramid is both the oldest and largest of the three, and the first building to exceed it in height would not be built for another 3,800 years!\n\nAlthough the three pyramids dominate the plateau, they are in fact surrounded by many other monuments. Every king\u2019s pyramid was just one element albeit the most important of a larger complex that included smaller, subsidiary, queens\u2019 pyramids; an additional one that acted as a second, symbolic, tomb for the king, called a satellite pyramid; mastaba tombs for nobility and other family members; burials of actual and/or symbolic boats; and a pair of temples linked by a richly decorated causeway. One of these temples, called the valley temple, led into the pyramid complex, and was located on or near a body of water where boats could dock. The other, the funerary (or upper) temple, stood near the base of the pyramid. Priests maintained the mortuary cult of the deceased king in these temples, where his divine aspect was worshiped, and where rich and diverse offerings were presented to his soul so he could have a peaceful and luxurious afterlife.",

                "name": "The Southern Tomb  \n",
                "description": "The South tomb is located at the southwestern corner of the King Djoser funeral complex, dating to the 3rd Dynasty, Old Kingdom period. This magnificent complex is the oldest stone building of the ancient world. Basically, it was named the \u201cSouthern Tomb'\u201d following its discovery by the English archaeologist Cecil Malaby Firth in 1928.\n\nSignificantly, the tomb is composed of an upper level in the form of a rectangular stone building. Its walls are decorated with a series of stone sockets in the form of entrances and exits, crowned by a frieze of cobra heads that symbolize protection and power.\n\nThe lower level of the tomb consists of an entrance towards a ramp leading to the burial chamber, which is located at the bottom of a great shaft measuring 7.5 x 7.5 m, and with a depth of approximately 31 m. It housesg a large sarcophagus made of 16 blocks of pink granite, each measuring approximately 3.60 metres high, 3.5 metres wide, and 3.6 metres long. urthermore, one can note the similarity between the shaft and the sarcophagus with those inside the step pyramid.\n\nOne of the most important architectural and decorative elements of the Southern Tomb are a series of corridors, one of which contains three false doors, each topped with exquisite reliefs depicting the king taking part in the Heb-Sed Festival. This was a vital event, a royal jubilee, with the aim of rejuvenating the king and renewing his right to rule. One can admire the king represented wearing the royal beard, as well as the White Crown of Upper Egypt. Several walls of the southern tomb\u2019s corridors are decorated with the same blue faience tiles into the step pyramid.\n\nVarious theories have been proposed about this tomb, as it is believed that it belonged to the royal wife of the king, or that it was built in order to house the internal organs of the king (lungs, stomach, intestines and liver).\n\nThe famous French Egyptologist Jean-Philippe Lauer undertook many important excavations at Saqqara, including the restoration and reconstruction of Djoser\u2019s Step Pyramid Complex throughout a period of over 70 years. Lauer believed that this South Tomb was a symbolic burial for the king\u2019s soul, replacing the royal tomb at Abydos (in the Sohag governorate).\n\nIn 2006, restoration work of the South Tomb began. It involved conservation and restoration work of the lower corridors, strengthening of the walls and ceilings, fixing of the blue faience tiles to complete the interior inscriptions in the tomb, as well as  reassembling and restoring the granite sarcophagus. In addition, this conservation project also included the paving of floors and the installation of a ladder; installations of indoor and outdoor lighting provide the visitor an enhanced and enjoyable experience.",

                "name": "Tomb of Horemheb\n",
                "description": "Horemheb (c.1323\u20131295 BC) was the last king of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Prior to his ascension to the throne, during the reign of Tutankhamun (c.1336\u20131327 BC), he was the highest-ranking military officer in the realm, and held other titles as lofty as \u201cthe King\u2019s Deputy in the Entire Land\u201d. He was ultimately buried in the Valley of the Kings as would befit his royal status. Before this, however, Horemheb had naturally begun work on another tomb, in Saqqara.\n\nThis tomb is the largest in the New Kingdom cemetery south of the causeway of the Fifth Dynasty King Unas (c.2375\u20132345 BC). Like the other major tombs in this cemetery, it is a temple-tomb, so named because it reflects the structure of contemporary great state temples. It is entered through a pylon gateway preceding two open-air courtyards that themselves precede the inner rooms of the chapel, where Horemheb\u2019s cult was practiced. The central room was surmounted by a pyramid, a solar symbol of rebirth. The burial chamber was underground, accessed through a vertical shaft cut through the floor of the inner courtyard. The discovery of the bones of a fetus along with a female skeleton, possibly of Horemheb\u2019s wife Mutnedjmet, in his Memphite tomb shows that it did not go unused.\n\nThe reliefs in this tomb include scenes depicting Horemheb carrying out his duties. One scene shows representatives of foreign rulers pleading before Tutankhamun, with Horemheb acting as intermediary. Two scenes in particular show his exalted status prior to his rise to kingship. Here, he is depicted followed by rows of foreign captives, being publicly rewarded with the Gold of Honor by Tutankhamun himself. The Gold of Honor was awarded by kings to their officials for exceptional service. The tomb is decorated with funerary scenes as well, one of which depicts the Opening of the Mouth ritual.\n\nThe location of this tomb was not always known. It was discovered in the early 19th century, when this area of Saqqara was explored by tomb-robbers and art dealers, who then sold their findings to museums and collectors abroad. These were not limited to statues and other portable objects. Entire sections of wall relief were removed, and none of the provenance was recorded. Horemheb\u2019s Memphite tomb was particularly affected, and its location was subsequently forgotten. Thankfully, it and the New Kingdom cemetery were eventually rediscovered in 1975.",

                "name": "New Kingdom Cemetery\n",
                "description": "The vast necropolis of Saqqara, which served as the cemetery of ancient Memphis, contains tombs from almost every period of Egyptian history. The New Kingdom (c.1550\u20131069 BC) cemetery south of the causeway of Unas is where several important officials of the Eighteenth to Twentieth Dynasties were buried. Among them are Ptahemwia, the \u201cRoyal Butler, Clean of Hands\u201d under Kings Akhenaten (c.1353\u20131336 BC) and Tutankhamun (c.1336\u20131327 BC), Maya, the overseer of the treasury under Tutankhamun, and Tia, the overseer of the treasury during the reign of Ramses II (c.1279\u20131213 BC). This is also the site of the tomb Horemheb was planning for himself before he became king.\n\nLike most private tombs, the tombs of this New Kingdom cemetery consist of two parts: a sealed underground section that includes the burial chamber, and the above-ground, accessible, tomb chapel, where the cult of the deceased was practiced. What sets the tombs of this cemetery apart, however, is the fact that they are neither mastabas nor rock-cut, but free-standing structures known as temple-tombs. The larger tombs, like the great state temples of the period (hence their name), were entered through a pylon gateway that led into an open-air courtyard that preceded the tomb chapel. The central chapel would have been surmounted by a small pyramid, a symbol of rebirth. A shaft in the forecourt led to the underground burial chamber.\n\nThis section of Saqqara was explored by tomb robbers and art dealers in the 19th century. Many statues and reliefs were taken without being recorded, and sold to museums and collectors abroad. A 19th century map of the area made by Prussian Egyptologist Karl R. Lepsius led to the rediscovery of the New Kingdom cemetery in 1975 by the Anglo-Dutch expedition of the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) in London and the National Museum of Antiquities, Leiden, led by Geoffrey T. Martin.",

        "description": "Located 40 km southwest of Cairo, Saqqara is one of the most important cemeteries of Memphis, which was itself one of the most important cities in ancient Egyptian history. The name of the site most likely derives from the god of this necropolis, Sokar.\n\n Saqqara is truly an open-air museum, one that has all of ancient Egyptian history on display. Kings and noblemen from the very first two dynasties (c.3040\u20132686 BC) were buried here, and this is also the location of the Step Pyramid of Djoser (c.2686\u20132667 BC).     \n\nThe pyramids of some of the most important kings of the Old Kingdom Fifth (c.2494\u20132345 BC) and Sixth (c.2345\u20132181 BC) Dynasties are located in Saqqara. One of these, the pyramid of Unas (also known as Wenis; (c.2375\u20132345 BC), features the oldest pyramid burial chamber decorated with texts. These are the so-called Pyramid Texts, the purpose of which was to protect the deceased king on his journey to the afterlife. In addition to Old Kingdom royal burials, Saqqara is also full of the tombs of the noblemen of this period, which are decorated with scenes and texts of outstanding beauty and craftsmanship.\n\nSaqqara also features tombs from the First Intermediate Period (c.2181\u20132055 BC), Middle Kingdom (c.2055\u20131650 BC), and New Kingdom (c.1550\u20131069 BC). The New Kingdom tombs display an architectural style completely different from their Upper Egyptian counterparts in Thebes. Among them is the tomb of none other than Horemheb (c.1323\u20131295 BC), the non-royal individual, the general, who became king. He was never buried here however, for, upon ascending the throne, he built a new tomb in the Valley of the Kings worthy of his royal rank.\n\n     Among the most important of Saqqara\u2019s monuments is the Serapeum, a series of underground galleries in which the Apis Bulls were buried from the Eighteenth Dynasty (c.1550\u20131295 BC) to the Ptolemaic Period (332\u201330 BC). The Apis Bull was considered an incarnation of Ptah himself, one of the most important gods of Memphis, and as such, there was only ever one Apis Bull at a time. When it died, it was buried with full honors until his successor could be found.\n\n     Egypt\u2019s Coptic era is featured in Saqqara as well through the remains of the Monastery of Apa Jeremiah, which was in use until the eighth century AD. Today, Saqqara is also the site of the Imhotep Museum, in which objects from the site\u2019s immense chronological span are displayed.",

It consists of a basement, three floors, four facades, and a circular tower lies on the northern corner and resembles those of war castles in the Middle Ages. The decorative motifs of the palace bear the influence of Andalusian, Moroccan, Ottoman, Renaissance arts, Greek and Roman architecture and decoration styles. A circular hall on the third floor was used as a studio for Princess Samiha.",

        "description": "The idea for the National Museum of Suez was conceived after the collapse of the older museum during the war in 1967. Its collection was moved to the storage rooms of the Egyptian Museum, on Tahrir Square. The Suez National Museum was established to serve as a cultural beacon and a touristic landmark shedding light on the history of the Suez Canal, which connects the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The museum gives an account of the history of the city of Suez and its antiquities from prehistory to the modern period. The museum was inaugurated in 2012. It consists of two floors divided by a large open hall in which different styles of columns are displayed.\n\nThe museum sheds light on the digging of the Suez Canal as well as other canals and their role in sea trade, such as the \"Canal of the Pharaohs\" dug by Nekau II. It also highlights the spheres of mining and shipbuilding, Egypt\u2019s commercial relationships, and the important part that Suez plays in the hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). One hall in the museum documents the resistance of the inhabitants of Suez against both British occupation and later, during the battle of October 1973. In addition to this is the Mummification Hall, which is one of the most important exhibitions in the entire museum, which displays the interior of tombs and presents the ancient Egyptian mummification process.\n\nOne of the most prominent objects is a statue of King Senwosret III dating to the Middle Kingdom (Twelfth Dynasty). The museum also includes a stela of the Persian king Darius I, one of four that he set up along the canal connecting the Nile with the Red Sea in commemoration of its excavation.\n\nThe museum also includes a library and an activities centre where different educational programs and events are held. The museum\u2019s garden contains a modern replica of a ship from the reign of Hatshepsut (The New Kingdom,18th Dynasty\u200b\u200b) of the type that she used to send on trading expeditions to faraway lands.",
